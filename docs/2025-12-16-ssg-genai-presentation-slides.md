# Evaluating GenAI in the SDLC
### A Maturity Framework for Diligence

## Slide 2: The Question PE Buyers Are Asking

> "Is this company using AI effectively to build software?"

**The problem:** Most targets claim they're "using AI" — but we lack a framework to assess it.

**The opportunity:** Structured diligence questions reveal actual maturity vs. marketing.

## Slide 3: The Three Levels of AI Adoption

| Level | Name | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| **1** | Assisted | Autocomplete, line-by-line, developer-initiated | GitHub Copilot |
| **2** | Agentic | AI takes on tasks, multi-file changes, human reviews output | Claude Code, Cursor Agent |
| **3** | Orchestrated | AI integrated into ALM workflows, triggered by events | Jira, Git, TCM + AI integration |

**Key insight:** Most targets are at Level 1 and don't know it.

---

## Slide 4: Why This Matters for Valuation

| Level | Valuation Signal |
|-------|------------------|
| **Level 1** | Table stakes — no differentiation |
| **Level 2** | Engineering leadership, velocity advantage |
| **Level 3** | Scalability without linear headcount growth |

**Diligence implication:** Level 2-3 adoption signals a more capital-efficient engineering organization.

## Slide 5: Tooling Questions

### What to Ask

1. **"What AI coding tools are developers using?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: "Copilot" and nothing else
   - 🟢 Green flag: Multiple tools, agentic options mentioned

2. **"How are these tools provisioned and governed?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: Ad-hoc, individual licenses, no visibility
   - 🟢 Green flag: Centralized provisioning, usage tracked

---

## Slide 6: Workflow Integration Questions

### What to Ask

3. **"At what points in your SDLC does AI assist?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: Only code writing
   - 🟢 Green flag: Code review, testing, documentation, investigation

4. **"How do developers trigger AI assistance?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: Manually in IDE only
   - 🟢 Green flag: Automated triggers from tickets, PRs, CI

### What Level 3 Looks Like

```
Labels trigger specific AI workflows:

| ai-investigate | Root cause analysis     |
| ai-fix         | Bug fix implementation  |
| ai-code-review | Automated code review   |
```

---

## Slide 7: Human-in-the-Loop Questions

### What to Ask

5. **"Who reviews AI-generated code before merge?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: No formal process
   - 🟢 Green flag: Defined approval gates

6. **"What's your rollback story for AI-generated changes?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: Blank stare
   - 🟢 Green flag: Same as any other code (git revert, feature flags)

### What Level 3 Looks Like

```
Jira ticket + label
    → AI investigates (read-only)
    → AI recommends approach
    → Human approves
    → AI implements + creates PR
    → Human merges
```

## Slide 8: Security Questions (1 of 2)

### What to Ask

7. **"How do you prevent AI from leaking secrets or credentials?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: "We trust the tool"
   - 🟢 Green flag: Sandboxing, secrets scanning on output

8. **"What data is sent to AI providers, and how is it classified?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: "Don't know"
   - 🟢 Green flag: Clear policy, no customer data without approval

9. **"How do you protect against prompt injection?"**
   - 🔴 Red flag: "What's prompt injection?"
   - 🟢 Green flag: Input/output separation, output validation, limited blast radius

### What Good Looks Like: Secrets Blocked

```json
"deny": [
  "Read(.env)", "Read(.env.*)",
  "Read(**/.env)", "Read(**/.env.*)"
]
```

---

## Slide 9: Security Questions (2 of 2)

### What to Ask

10. **"What permissions does the AI have in your environment?"**
    - 🔴 Red flag: Developer-level access to everything
    - 🟢 Green flag: Scoped to task, sandboxed filesystem/network

11. **"How do you detect if AI-generated code introduces vulnerabilities?"**
    - 🔴 Red flag: "Same as regular code review"
    - 🟢 Green flag: Automated security scans, specific review protocols

### What Good Looks Like: Read-Only Sandbox

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read(**)", "Glob(**)", "Grep(**)", "Bash(git log:*)"],
    "deny": ["Write(**)", "Edit(**)", "WebFetch", "Bash(curl:*)"]
  }
}
```

### What Good Looks Like: Agent Isolation

```python
result = subprocess.run(
    ["claude", "-p", prompt, "--output-format", "json"],
    cwd=work_dir,        # Restricted to cloned repo
    capture_output=True,
    timeout=self._timeout,
)
```

---

## Slide 10: Measurement Questions

### What to Ask

12. **"How do you measure AI's impact on velocity?"**
    - 🔴 Red flag: Anecdotes ("developers love it")
    - 🟢 Green flag: Metrics (cycle time, PR throughput, defect rates)

13. **"What's the adoption rate across teams?"**
    - 🔴 Red flag: "A few power users"
    - 🟢 Green flag: Org-wide rollout with training

---

## Slide 11: Red Flags & Green Flags Summary

| Area | 🔴 Red Flag | 🟢 Green Flag |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Tooling** | Copilot only, ad-hoc licenses | Multiple tools, centralized |
| **Workflow** | Manual IDE only | Automated triggers, multi-stage |
| **Human-in-Loop** | No formal review | Defined approval gates |
| **Security** | "We trust the tool" | Sandboxing, permission scoping |
| **Secrets** | No policy | Explicit blocking, scanning |
| **Measurement** | Anecdotes | Quantified velocity metrics |

---

## Slide 12: Key Takeaways

### The Framework
- **Level 1 (Assisted)** → Table stakes, no moat
- **Level 2 (Agentic)** → Engineering advantage
- **Level 3 (Orchestrated)** → Scalable automation

### The Three Questions That Reveal the Most
1. "At what points in your SDLC does AI assist?" (workflow maturity)
2. "What permissions does the AI have?" (security posture)
3. "How do you measure AI's impact?" (organizational maturity)

### The Bottom Line
Companies that can't articulate their AI strategy beyond "we use Copilot" are at Level 1 — and that's increasingly insufficient.

- **Three-Pillar Defense Framework:**
  1. **Architecture** — Treat LLM as function, not agent
  2. **Containment** — OS-level sandboxes, fresh environment per task
  3. **Detection** — Structured prompts, output validation, denial logging

## Speaker Notes

### Timing Guide (15-20 min total)
- Slides 1-4 (Framework): 4-5 min
- Slides 5-7 (Workflow/Human-in-Loop): 4-5 min
- Slides 8-9 (Security): 4-5 min
- Slides 10-12 (Measurement/Summary): 3-4 min

### Key Points to Emphasize
- The gap between Level 1 and Level 2-3 is significant and most targets don't know it
- Code snippets are from a working implementation, not hypothetical
- Security questions are the most differentiating — most targets haven't thought about prompt injection
- The framework gives Partners a vocabulary for discussing AI maturity with clients
